                WordPress website built for a non-profit volunteer group based out of Wisconsin. The team that developed this consisted of me (software-developer), a graphic design student, and two marketing students. Our team competed agianst two other working groups for this client. Our implementation was chosen. Communication between fellow team members and the client was paramount. Link to the website below.

                <h3>ASP.net E-Commerce Website</h3>
                <img class="webdevportfolio" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.compass.asp }}">
                <p>
                    Desktop application for purchasing rare coins and bank notes. Built using ASP.net, webforms, and a Microsoft database. Complete with user account system, shopping cart, and administrator section. The primary purpose of building this was to get experience with the MVC programming architecture.
                </p>
                <h3>Angular/Ionic Addon</h3>
                <img class="webdevportfolio" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.compass.angular }}">
                <p>
                    Mobile application for purchasing rare coins and bank notes. Built with Angular and Ionic, and run on a Node.js server. Has all the functionality of the desktop application and also connects to the same Microsoft database. An API controller had to be built in the ASP.net application to accept, process, and return database information when pinged with an http request.
                </p>
                <h3>Bitcoin Block Explorer</h3>
                <img class="webdevportfolio" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.compass.btc }}">
                <p>
                    Application for searching Bitcoin blocks. I combined an implementation of Bitcoin software called Bcoin with a NodeJs server configured with the Express framework. A search would run as follows; User searches, NodeJs server recieves the request, NodeJs pings the Bcoin node via http, Bcoin returns data, the NodeJs server formats a view for the user.
